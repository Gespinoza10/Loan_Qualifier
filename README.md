# Loan Qualifier with Python

An application that will prompt users for personal financial data in order to verify if a lending loan is within their reach. This application will also save the qualyfying loans, if any, to a new CSV file. 


As a user, I need the ability to save the qualifying loans to a CSV file so that I can share the results as a spreadsheet.
### Sample Usage

Run `python app.py` from your local terminal. 

Enter a path to the rate sheet you'd like to use, in this case I am using `daily_rate_sheet.csv` that is inside of the `Data` folder. `daily_rate_sheet.csv` contains a list of banks for lending loans.
